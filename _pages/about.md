Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Master's Student in the Electrical and Systems Department at University of Pennsylvania advised by [Dr. Victor M. Preciado](https://sites.google.com/site/victormpreciado/). 

I am currently focusing on deep learning at scale, designing algorithms to utilize multiple compute nodes and neural accelerators at training and inference time. I have interest in robot learning mainly on designing estimation and control. 

Previously I worked in Indian Institute of Science incubated startup, started by [Dr. Humanshu Tyagi](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~htyagi/) (Asscoiate Professor, ECE Department @ Indian Institute of Science). I was involved in building robust pipeline connecting network simulators with Open- RAN's near Real Time RAN Intelligent Controller. 

Simultaneously, I was guided by [Dr. Shikha Tripathi](https://staff.pes.edu/nm1046/) (Chairperson, ECE Department @ PES University) on developing Koopman based techniques and deep neural networks to predict the nonlinear dynamics of the all-terrain autonomous robot. 

Before I joined UPenn, I graduated with Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication specializing in Signal Processing and Control Systems. Currently I am  working as Teaching Assistant for the Foundations of Data Science (ESE 3050) course. To view my projects you can visit [projects](/projects/).
