Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Graduate Student at University of Pennsylvania in the Electrical and Systems Department advised by [Dr. Victor M. Preciado](https://sites.google.com/site/victormpreciado/). 

I'm currently focusing on deep learning at scale, designing algorithms to utilize multiple compute nodes and neural accelerators at training and inference time. I have interest in robot learning mainly on designing estimation and control. 

Previously I worked in Indian Institute of Science incubated startup, started by [Dr. Humanshu Tyagi](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~htyagi/) (Asscoiate Professor, ECE Department @ Indian Institute of Science). I was involved in building robust pipeline connecting network simulators with Open- RAN's near Real Time RAN Intelligent Controller. 

Simultaneously, I was guided by [Dr. Shikha Tripathi](https://staff.pes.edu/nm1046/) (Chairperson, ECE Department @ PES University) on developing Koopman based techniques and deep neural networks to predict the nonlinear dynamics of the all-terrain autonomous robot. 

Before I joined UPenn, I graduated with B.Tech in Electronics and Communication specializing in Signal Processing and Control Systems. Currently I'm Teaching Assistant for the Foundations of Data Science (ESE 3050) with my roles such as solving students doubts, helding office hours and grading programming projects.
